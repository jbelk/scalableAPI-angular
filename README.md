#Example of using Scalable API with AngularJS

- [Link to Example](http://scalableangularapi.site44.com/)

This application uses the Scalable Press API to show all of the available products in real-time. The application shows all of the categories and there associated products and images.

The example uses the angular $resourceProvider to make API calls in a dynamic fashion.

Note: The package.json file is configured to run in Codio.com IDE. So this file may need to be re-configured to run locally.
